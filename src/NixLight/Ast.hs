-- | Nix's binding can be of three forms (we currently only consider the case

-- 2. inherit x1 â€¦ xn;
-- 3. inherit (e) x1 _ xn;
--
-- The first one is kept as it is, the second one is translated to n binding of
-- the form @inherit xi@ (or mor exactly @xi = inherit@ and the third one is
-- translated to n binding of the form @xi = r.xi@.
